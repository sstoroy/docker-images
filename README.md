# Docker Images Webpage

Built with [Eleventy ](https://www.11ty.dev) and [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com).

Design based on [my resume](https://sstoroy.github.io/resume).

## How to use

1. Create a folder under `/src/_data/`for your application. Give the application folder a name that works on all devices (so no spaces or funny symbols), like `my_awesome_application`.

2. In that folder, create a file `info.txt`. The first line of that folder contains the proper name of the application, like `My ðŸ˜„Awesomeâš¡ Application!`. This line is obligatory, as the script will skip any and all archives belonging to the application if you don't write something here.

3. The second line in `info.txt` is optional, and should be a link to the source code of the project.

4. Still in the folder, create a subfolder for each version of the application and store the relevant application and Docker files there. 

When starting the server, the script will create an archive folder under `/dist/assets/` where it stores the created archives. The script also outputs information and/or errors in the console log with the prefix `[DockerArchiver]`.
